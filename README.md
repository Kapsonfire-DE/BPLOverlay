# BPLOverlay
BPLOverlay is a electron based ingame overlay for Path of Exile to support players in Badgers Private League with several informations like current ladder rank, teaminternal notifications and ingame item scoring check.
Since its a external overlay these things won't be captured by obs/xsplit and other capturing software when using "game capture" - so its safe to use for streams without exposing further information.

## Features
```yaml

Planned:
- Track current ladder place

```

## Ideas/Suggestions
